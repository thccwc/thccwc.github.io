        <h1>This Man</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Reported evidence of This Man appearing in dreams allegedly goes back to the 1980s. According to the Ever Dream This Man? website, the first image of This Man was sketched in January 2006 by a "well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York</a>", based on the descriptions of a patient who claims he was a recurring subject in dreams, despite never knowing a man like him in real life. Several days later, another of the psychiatrist's patients recognized the drawing and said he was a figure in his dreams as well; the psychiatrist sent the image to fellow professionals, and collected the testimony of four more people who claimed to recognize the man. Since then, more than 8,000 people from cities across the world, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/São_Paulo">São Paulo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran">Tehran</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing">Beijing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town">Cape Town</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul">Seoul</a>, <a href="hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya">Nagoya</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh">Riyadh</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi">New Delhi</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow">Moscow</a>, claimed to have seen the man while sleeping.</p>
        <p>Anonymous stories from alleged witnesses vary in his behavior and actions in their dreams, whose content ranges from romantic or sexual fantasies, attacking and killing the dreamer, to giving cryptic life advice. His relationship with the dreamer varied between accounts; in one, he was the dreamer's father, while in another, he was a schoolteacher from Brazil with six fingers on his right hand. His voice was also unidentifiable due to the fact that he rarely spoke, as well as the difficulty in remembering sounds in dreams versus images. There were some recurring themes in his messages, such as telling dreamers to "go North."</p>
