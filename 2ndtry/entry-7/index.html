                The story typically in Fukushima Prefecture. Begins with a group of friends or a person encountering a strange woman or girl who introduces herself as “Sara Sara.” She is often described as red dress and having long, black hair, pale skin, and an eerie demeanor.
<br>
<br>
The story starts with a group of friends or an individual coming across Acrobatic Sara Sara in a park, on a train, or in a deserted area. She may appear to be lost or in need of help, and she will strike up a conversation with them. Acrobatic Sara Sara then proceeds to perform an impressive acrobatic act, such as climbing trees or performing handstands. She may even challenge the witnesses to perform similar feats, which they are unable to accomplish.
<br>
<br>
After the performance, Acrobatic Sara Sara suddenly vanishes without a trace, leaving the witnesses confused and frightened. According to the legend, those who witness Sara Sara’s acrobatic performance are cursed and will face misfortune or even death. The consequences vary depending on the version of the story, but they often include accidents, illnesses, or the untimely demise of the witnesses or their loved ones. The legend usually ends with a warning for the listeners not to help or interact with Sara Sara if they encounter her, as doing so will bring about the curse.
